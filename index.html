    <h2>ABOUT THE CATHEDRAL</h2>

    <p>
      THE CATHEDRAL is a relatively normal blog despite its pretentious and obviously stolen name: its goal is to supplement your thought processes. We’ve all seen The Matrix. We've probably heard of Mencius Moldbug. We know about red pills, blue pills, black pills—the whole repertoire of cultural metaphors. Many claim to sell them. You can go, for example, to any blog site, youtube channel, Spotify podcast, or substack page and peruse through their catalog for some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment">Nrx Dark Enlightenment shit</a>. What you'll get are black pills soaked in brown #4.
    </p>
    <p>Since we provide pretty standard articles, <em>TC</em> is pretty much the anti-Moldbug. (As a broad generalization, <em>TC's</em> stance in any controversy will be the opposite of Moldbug's. Though, sometimes, there are often starking overlaps) Take one of our red pills—heck, split one in half and wash it down with some blue stuff—and you’ll see the world in varying dimensions.</p>
