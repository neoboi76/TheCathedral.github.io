        Corporatocracy is defined as a socioeconomic and political system characterized by the rule of private corporations (Oxford Dictionary, 2012). Such a system entails the capitalist mode of production and, along with it, the persistence of the profit motive. The definition here given shall inform the various senses in which the term "corporate tyranny" is used. The first use of the term relates to tyranny in the political, economic, and social realmsâ€”in short, a corporatocracy. Another sense in which the word is used refers to the tyranny in the workplace, a tyranny of the interests of the employers and shareholders ( e.g., the executive department), in stark opposition to the interests of the employees on the lower end of the company.

      <p>The following post shall elucidate the meaning hitherto implied by such terms, that the tyranny of corporations within its legal borders and its influence in the realm of political decision-making is a natural consequence of the predominant capitalist mode of production. The paper shall argue that while the interests of the workers and the corporate elite are in conflict with one another, as evidenced by the structure of modern corporations, such a relationship is reinforced by the consolidation of economic power through the procurement of political power in government; nevertheless,  only by gradually adopting a model of worker democracy through worker cooperatives can such tyranny be reduced.

        In discussing corporate tyranny in both senses of the term, what is important to consider is the driving force behind such. The tyranny within the workplace and the tyranny affected by private corporations in the public sphere are the explicit manifestations of the profit motive inherent to capitalism. The profit motive is the motive of any entity in society, whether it be a businessman, consumer, or blue-collar worker, to benefit from the fruits of their labor (Schwartz, 1977). However, the term more commonly refers to its corporate context, that is, the motive that encouraged corporations to maximize their profits with a view to their shareholders' interests and to minimize any costs incurred (such as labor) by any means necessary. Thus, the profit motive is what motivates the current global economic system and is an important factor in influencing the manifestation of political tyranny from within the confines of a corporation to society as a whole.
